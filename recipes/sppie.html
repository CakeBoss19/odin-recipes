        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A tasty pie made from sweet potatoes, and always an interesting addition at
                Thanksgiving or at anytime of year!! This recipe was shared with me by a special
                friend in Atlanta, GA. It has long been a favorite, and everyone who tastes
                it says it is the best they have ever had.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (1 pound) sweet potato</li>
                <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
                <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla textract</li>
                <li>1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2> 
             <ol>
                <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
                <p>Boil sweet potato whole in skin for 40 to 50 minutes, or until done.
                    Run cold water over the sweet potato, and remove the skin.</p>
                <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
                <p>Break apart sweet potato in a bowl. Add butter, and mix well with mixer.
                    Stir in sugar, milk, eggs, nutmeg, cinnamon and vanilla.
                    Beat on medium speed until mixture is smooth. Pour filling into our unbaked,
                    <a href="piecrust.html">homemade pie crust</a>.</p>
                <l><strong>Step 3</strong></l>
                <p>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 55 to 60 minutes, or until
                    knife inserted in center comes out clean. Pie will puff up like a souffle,
                    and then will sink down as it cools.</p>
