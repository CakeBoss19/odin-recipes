        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>We took a couple shortcuts for this recipe by using store-bought marinara and boxed pasta
            sheets. It saves a ton of time without sacrificing any flavor. We think it's absolutely
            perfect as-is, but also understand some people are looking to make sauce from scratch.

        <p>Regardless of the route you go, make sure to follow these tips—we've reworked
            this recipe based on user comments to make it even better with more meat, more sauce,
            and more cheese!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 lb. lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 tsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
            <li>2 lb. ground beef</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 (32-oz.) jars marinara</li>
            <li>16 oz. whole milk ricotta</li>
            <li>1/2 c. freshly grated Parmesan, divided</li>
            <li>1/4 c. chopped parsley, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 lb. sliced mozzarella</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Step One</li>
                <p>Preheat oven to 375º. In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta
                    according to package directions until al dente, less 2 minutes. Drain and
                    drizzle a bit of olive oil to prevent noodles from sticking together. </p>
            <li>Step Two</li>
                <p>Meanwhile, in a large pot over medium-high heat, heat oil. Cook ground beef
                    until no longer pink, breaking up with a wooden spoon. Remove from heat and
                    drain fat. Return beef to skillet and add garlic and oregano and cook,
                    stirring, for 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper, then add marinara and
                    stir until warmed through. </p>
            <li>Step Three</li>
                <p>Combine ricotta, 1/4 cup Parmesan, parsley, and egg in a large mixing bowl and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.</p>
            <li>Step Four</li>
                <p>In a large casserole dish, evenly spread a quarter of the meat sauce across the bottom of the dish, then top with a single layer of lasagna noodles, a layer of ricotta mixture, a single layer of mozzarella, and a layer of meat sauce. Repeat layers, topping the last layer of noodles with meat sauce, Parmesan, and mozzarella. </p>
            <li>Step Five</li>
                <p>Cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes, then increase temperature to 400º and bake uncovered for 18 to 20 minutes.</p>
            <li>Step Six</li> 
                <p>Garnish with parsley before serving.</p>
