        <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
        <p>Well, here we are. My first actual Odin Project "project." Here I have pulled together a recipe book of a few things. The project mostly serves as an example of what I have learned so far in the curriculum, and less so and actual cook-book. Nonetheless, I have done my best to present these recipes, using only html, in a fashionable and organized manner. I tried to incorporate links within pages linked from the index file, like an actual website would.</p>
