A simple recipe webpage.

    In my first true project for "The Odin Project", I intend to create a simple 
    recipe website from scratch using everything I learned in the first few lessons of this
    program. 

    I intend to wisely use headings<h1>, paragraphs<p>, links<a>, images<img src="" alt="">, and all other devices necessary to produce a functioning and aesthetically pleasing website.
